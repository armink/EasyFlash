 * |(IAP)Downloaded application |   IAP already downloaded application, unfixed size

 *
 * The EasyFlash add the NG (Next Generation) mode start from V4.0. All old mode before V4.0, called LEGACY mode.
 *
 * - NG (Next Generation) mode is default mode from V4.0. It's easy to settings, only defined the ENV_AREA_SIZE.
 * - The LEGACY mode has been DEPRECATED. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to continue using.
 *   Beacuse it will use ram to buffer the ENV and spend more flash erase times.
 *   If you want use it please using the V3.X version.
